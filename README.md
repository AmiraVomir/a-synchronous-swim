# a-synchronous-swim
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

Your synchronized swim team is ready to take commands from you! Right now, they can only hear your commands when issued from within the client. They'll be a better team if they can receive your commands when you are away from the client too. Your goal is to make both the server program and client program coordinate the activities of the swim team.

## Goals

* Learn how to work with two different programs and get them to coordinate with each other
* Gain more experience with asynchronous behaviors through the use of keyboard events and network events
* Achieve a deeper understanding of how client and server systems interact with each other through CORS, uploading of files, requests, and responses.
* Learn to write tests, use binary data, buffers, as well as reading and writing files to the hard drive.
